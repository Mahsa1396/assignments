# Homework: Dissertation Presentation

*This is the public posting of the assignment. See Piazza for the invite link to make your submission in your own repository in the class organization*

**Due:** Tuesday, March 31, 2020 *before* class 

Acknowledgement: This assignment was inspired by the ["Dissertationpalooza!"](https://phonedude.github.io/cs891-f17/dissertationpalooza.html) from [CS 891 at ODU](https://phonedude.github.io/cs891-f17/).

The main goals of this assignment are to:
* familiarize you with prior work in your research area
* provide an example of successful PhD dissertations
* give you practice at presenting others' research

## Assignment

Work with your advisor to select an appropriate dissertation. Preferably, this should be one from your research group at ODU ([ODU-CS theses and dissertations](https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/computerscience_etds/)). If your advisor is a new faculty member, this could potentially be their dissertation or one from a comparable research group.

You will read the dissertation and prepare and deliver a 20-minute presentation. The original authors had approximately an hour to present their research, you will have about 20 minutes (with questions and discussion, the entire presentation should fit into a 25-minute slot). Since you have less than half of the original time, you will need to focus on the research questions, technical highlights, and the contributions of the dissertation; there will not be time to present the work in its entirety.

Feel free to use figures and tables from the dissertation (be sure to mark their number from the original work), but the slides and text must be your own work – not a simplified version of the original slides. You’re presenting your perspective on their work – not just a [karaoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaoke) version of the original presentation.

**Online Students:** If you can attend class in person on one of the presentation days (March 31 - April 23), you are welcome to present live. If not, you will have to record yourself giving the presentation. You are strongly encouraged to create conditions similar to giving the talk in person, such as recording a video where you are presenting the work standing in front of a screen (a large TV works, too) rather than a talking head over a set of slides. 

Although the presentations will be given over the period of a month, everyone has the same due date for their presentation materials (March 31). We will work on scheduling the presentation slots before Spring Break.

After the submission deadline, I will download all presentations to the classroom computer.

## Submission

You only need to submit a Markdown file with the following information:
* Date you are scheduled to present
* Reference line for the dissertation you are presenting<br/>
  Ex: Mat Kelly, "Aggregating Private and Public Web Archives Using the Mementity Framework," PhD thesis, Old Dominion University, August 2019.
* Link to the dissertation you are presenting<br/>
  Ex: https://digitalcommons.odu.edu/computerscience_etds/94/
* Link to your presentation slides.
<br/>These can be published as Google Slides, pushed to Slideshare (with option to download), or as a PDF/PPT in your GitHub repo.

Submit the URL of your Markdown file in Homeworks > Presentation in Blackboard.
